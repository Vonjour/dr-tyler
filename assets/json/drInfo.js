		"question" : "Does the Longevity Center accept insurance?",
		"answer" : "<p>The Longevity Center does not bill insurance. However, if you have a PPO insurance plan you may be able to get a portion of your fees reimbursed from your insurance company (see below).</p><p>In order for our clinic to provide the most effective care we can, we operate outside of the insurance system. We do this because insurance companies incentivize health care providers to have short visits that don't allow physicians to do thorough examinations of a patient's case, and have treatment guidelines based on this flawed system. This does a disservice to patients.</p><p>While we do not bill insurance, we can provide you with a statement that you can submit to a PPO insurance plan. To determine if you coverage through your insurance carrier, the first thing you should do is call them. Some helpful questions you can ask your insurance carrier:<ul><li>What are my preventative care health benefits?</li><li>What is the coverage amount per treatment?</li><ul></p>"

However, if you need to see an OBGYN, cardiologist, or surgeon for example, you will be referred appropriately.</p>"

				"content" : "<p>Just about everyone knows someone who had a heart attack in their 40’s or early fifties.  Sadly, this first heart attack is often fatal. Here at the LA Longevity Center we are committed to making sure this will never happen to you.</p><p>The medical profession has long known that heart attacks are the leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States. And yet heart attacks can be prevented. You are probably wondering, ‘how can a preventable illness be the number one killer of Americans?’ The reason is simple. The process that leads to heart attacks is silent. By the time it ‘announces’ itself, it’s too late: you’ve just had a heart attack or are on the verge of having one. Let’s explore this.</p><p>The disease that leads to heart attacks is called atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is the condition in which a fatty substance called plaque develops in the walls of your heart arteries.  Under the wrong conditions, this plaque can rupture off the arterial wall and form a clot which blocks blood from flowing to the heart muscle. When heart muscle is deprived of blood, it dies. This is a heart attack.  Often this occurs before the plaque has caused any symptoms. It’s literally a silent killer.</p><p>Plaque surreptitiously develops in our arteries as we age.  For some it may be very little, but for others it can be substantial. At our center, we do a comprehensive analysis of your blood and your genes to determine if you are at risk of developing atherosclerosis. We also do tests which can literally visualize the amount of plaque that currently exists in your arteries.  Through this testing we can establish the stage of your atherosclerosis. This staging is a very reliable way to predict your chance of a future heart attack. The best part of this analysis is that once we figure out your risk, we can recommend a variety of treatment modalities to substantially reduce or even eliminate the possibility of you having a heart attack.</p><p>So be pro-active. Come on in and let us test you for early heart disease.</p>"
